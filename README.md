> **Why this list?** Claude Code runs shell commands, edits files, calls APIs, and installs MCP servers — all with your user privileges. One malicious `.claude/settings.json`, a poisoned MCP tool, or a prompt injection hidden in a README can lead to RCE, credential theft, or silent data exfiltration. This list exists to help you harden, govern, and monitor every surface.
